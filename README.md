# Relational DBMS

A SQL based project that was developed as an assignment for the subject of Databases. The goal of this project is to design a relational database for storing the data of a football cup. We generated hypothetical database entries using Mockaroo for random data generation. We designed SQL queries for creating tables, managing records, filtering and defining relationships. We perform database normalization based on Third-Normal-Form (3NF) and Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF). We setup triggers and cursors to ensure data integrity and perform maintenance. Finally, we have written a program in Java using the JDBC client to simulate real world consumption of the database.

I provide the SQL code as well as the exported files and the documentation in greek ( [Documentation_DataBases.pdf](https://github.com/AlexhsV/FootballCup-Database/files/12252742/Documentation_DataBases.pdf)
 ). The assignment outline (also in greek) can also be found in the files.
